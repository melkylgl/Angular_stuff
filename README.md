### Angular Staff
This is my first Angular repository ...

### Node.JS
Motore javascript.

> Node.js is JavaScript on steroids. Initially, a fork of the V8 JavaScript engine from the Google Chrome browser, Node.js was extended with more functionality, specifically to make JavaScript useful on the server-side

Verifica installazione:
```javascript
node -e "console.log('Hello World');"
```


### NPM
Gestore di pacchetti per Node.JS
> The node package manager, NPM, is a door to over 200,000 packages and libraries that can help you build your own application or library
